      <br />I.<br /><br />
      Place your ear to the wall <br />quiet your breath. <br />Listen to the
      hum of the world. <br />Feel part of it, <br />Feel as if you will always
      be separate. <br /><br />

      II. <br /><br />Everything isn’t serious. I’ll give you an example.<br />
      Softly suspending your grandmother’s hand in yours <br />as she steadily
      quieted into death, <br />the family, home and already grieving, leaving
      you alone <br />to be the steward of her pain. Calling your father to tell
      him <br />his mother died, holding onto what it sounded like when she took
      <br />her last breath. These are serious things. <br /><br />
      By contrast, I once walked into a window of a crowded bank <br />mistaking
      it for a door. My forehead hit the pane hard, <br />it sounded like a
      large china bowl being dropped onto the ground <br />but somehow, not
      breaking. <br /><br />

      III.<br /><br />
      I met a woman who carried death with her everywhere she went. It was a
      stillness that stunk of old flowers and cigarettes. She was a perfectly
      nice woman. Nothing about her personality or her behavior made me feel
      this way. Just a complete and unending certainty that she was a harbinger.
      She talked of dead pets, dead friends, dead parents, of art and of love.
      These were the things she was an expert in. Her shoulders straightened,
      gaze evened. The look of an athlete about to run the big race.<br /><br />
      She was an unwitting harbinger. She took no more pleasure in being
      followed by death than anyone else would. Her pale wavy hair wild and
      uncontrollable, my sitting across from her as still as stone. Off in the
      distance, maybe outside, I heard a hiss and the movement of leaves. When
      she departed, something in me left with her. After the door closed and her
      car pulled away I collapsed in bed and slept for fourteen hours.
      <br /><br />IV.<br /><br />
      Everything is quiet again, B. <br />This is why I gave up poetry the first
      time.<br />
      When it’s quiet the fear comes. <br />The belt around my chest, it
      tightens. <br />I’m afraid of myself. <br />I’m afraid of the unlit
      corners <br />and dusty doorways. <br />What if I never find my way home
      to you? <br />Why must I feel the need <br />to speak where no one needs
      <br />sound?<br /><br />
      V.<br /><br />
      Sometimes the lie is so much lovelier than the truth. I’ll give you an
      example: I know that the first words ever spoken were probably something
      like water or lion or run or fire, something necessary, something vital.
      But I like to believe that maybe after thousands of years of silence,
      someone looked at someone and said, “I wonder if those stars watch us
      every night like we watch them.” I think that would be nice, don’t you? Or
      maybe if God came down one Tuesday afternoon and everybody got out of
      their cars or walked out of their incredibly important jobs and he just
      said, “what are you in a rush for all the time? I made all of this soft
      grass, lie in it.” <br /><br />VI. <br /><br />I heard the guru on the
      television say <br />forgiving yourself is the greatest act of kindness.
      <br />He sat in condescending splendor, arms folded <br />knees crossed,
      surrounded on all sides by faithful followers. <br />I remember my mother
      in the intensive care unit. I remember <br />the faint conversations we
      had over the sound of respirators <br />and nurses shoes squeaking on
      waxed floor. I remember the days I <br />would come and sit alone while
      you slept. I was a coward, then. <br />I didn’t tell you how sorry I was
      for all of my teenage angst and <br />all the nights I was out and manic
      and you were home and waiting <br />and worrying. <br />I am still a
      coward now. <br />Maybe the guru was right. <br />Maybe forgiving myself
      really is the greatest act of kindness. <br />But I don’t make a habit
      <br />of forgiving those I hate.<br /><br />
      
      VI. 
<br /><br />
I remember driving home<br />
from the third day at the factory thinking <br />
I am not cut out for this world<br />
as if there was a blurry outline drawn on a sheet<br />
of construction paper of a boy<br />
who would grow up to be a man<br />
who would be afraid of the dark <br />
and of men who reminded him of his father<br />
and of small talk with cashiers who seem too friendly<br />
and of falling back into solitude <br />
and of dying <br />
who when cut out and blown into the wind<br />
of some faraway place would take running<br />
out and over the horizon<br />
lit on each side by shadow <br />
cast by the two moons of that world.<br />
it would be soft and peaceful<br />
he would smile easy<br />
and never remember the names<br />
of all of the prescription drugs<br />
he would never need.<br /><br />


VII.<br /><br />

When I was in second grade <br />
I pretended to know all the answers to an episode of Jeopardy!. <br />
I had seen the episode before, but my friend’s parents didn’t know that. <br />
It’s the opposite of “malafide” <br />
Bonafide, obviously. <br />
Persephone, who reigned with him over the underworld, was his niece<br />
I’m pretty sure this one’s Hades.<br />
They were astonished, maybe a bit frightened. <br />
For an evening I was the kid genius,<br />
The star attraction.<br />
When my mom came to pick me up they gushed,<br />
my god your son is so smart!<br />
We stopped for ice cream on the way home for “no reason.”<br />
It was the first time I ever learned how good it felt<br />
to be a fraud. <br />
But I would spend the next 25 years feeling like one. <br /><br />

IX. <br /><br />

Last night I thought about crashing my car into a tollbooth. I saw it about a mile before, glowing like a lighthouse. It wasn’t a thought, really. It was like a feeling. I didn’t want to die, I wanted to hear the sound it made. That splash of metal slamming into metal that makes the hair on your neck stand up. I wanted to see the look on everybody’s faces when they saw I wasn’t slowing down. I wanted to feel the airbag on my cheek. I wanted to smell the gasoline running out onto the pavement. I didn’t want to die, I think I just wanted someone to run to me.

<br /><br />
X.
<br /><br />
A good line is like a shard of a mirror. <br />
You find it, you examine it. <br /><br />

You see yourself <br />
reflected back at you.<br /><br />

XI.<br /><br />

When asked about what his intention was for writing films, Ingmar Bergman responded, “There is an old story of how the cathedral of Chartres was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. Then thousands of people came from all points of the compass, like a giant procession of ants, and together they began to rebuild the cathedral on its old site. They worked until the building was completed — master builders, artists, laborers, clowns, noblemen, priests, burghers. But they all remained anonymous, and no one knows to this day who built the cathedral of Chartres.”

<br /><br />
XII.
<br /><br />
I want to die on the steps of my own cathedral.<br />
That is all I could ever ask for. <br /><br />
