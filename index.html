    <h1>Days In Dysthymia</h1>

      <br />I.<br /><br />
      Place your ear to the wall <br />quiet your breath. <br />Listen to the
      hum of the world. <br />Feel part of it, <br />Feel as if you will always
      be separate. <br /><br />

      II. <br /><br />Everything isn’t serious. I’ll give you an example.<br />
      Softly suspending your grandmother’s hand in yours <br />as she steadily
      quieted into death, <br />the family, home and already grieving, leaving
      you alone <br />to be the steward of her pain. Calling your father to tell
      him <br />his mother died, holding onto what it sounded like when she took
      <br />her last breath. These are serious things. <br /><br />
      By contrast, I once walked into a window of a crowded bank <br />mistaking
      it for a door. My forehead hit the pane hard, <br />it sounded like a
      large china bowl being dropped onto the ground <br />but somehow, not
      breaking. <br /><br />

      III.<br /><br />
      I met a woman who carried death with her everywhere she went. It was a
      stillness that stunk of old flowers and cigarettes. She was a perfectly
      nice woman. Nothing about her personality or her behavior made me feel
      this way. Just a complete and unending certainty that she was a harbinger.
      She talked of dead pets, dead friends, dead parents, of art and of love.
      These were the things she was an expert in. Her shoulders straightened,
      gaze evened. The look of an athlete about to run the big race.<br /><br />
      She was an unwitting harbinger. She took no more pleasure in being
      followed by death than anyone else would. Her pale wavy hair wild and
      uncontrollable, my sitting across from her as still as stone. Off in the
      distance, maybe outside, I heard a hiss and the movement of leaves. When
      she departed, something in me left with her. After the door closed and her
      car pulled away I collapsed in bed and slept for fourteen hours.
      <br /><br />IV.<br /><br />
      Everything is quiet again, B. <br />This is why I gave up poetry the first
      time.<br />
      When it’s quiet the fear comes. <br />The belt around my chest, it
      tightens. <br />I’m afraid of myself. <br />I’m afraid of the unlit
      corners <br />and dusty doorways. <br />What if I never find my way home
      to you? <br />Why must I feel the need <br />to speak where no one needs
      <br />sound?<br /><br />
      V.<br /><br />
      Sometimes the lie is so much lovelier than the truth. I’ll give you an
      example: I know that the first words ever spoken were probably something
      like water or lion or run or fire, something necessary, something vital.
      But I like to believe that maybe after thousands of years of silence,
      someone looked at someone and said, “I wonder if those stars watch us
      every night like we watch them.” I think that would be nice, don’t you? Or
      maybe if God came down one Tuesday afternoon and everybody got out of
      their cars or walked out of their incredibly important jobs and he just
      said, “what are you in a rush for all the time? I made all of this soft
      grass, lie in it.” <br /><br />VI. <br /><br />I heard the guru on the
      television say <br />forgiving yourself is the greatest act of kindness.
      <br />He sat in condescending splendor, arms folded <br />knees crossed,
      surrounded on all sides by faithful followers. <br />I remember my mother
      in the intensive care unit. I remember <br />the faint conversations we
      had over the sound of respirators <br />and nurses shoes squeaking on
      waxed floor. I remember the days I <br />would come and sit alone while
      you slept. I was a coward, then. <br />I didn’t tell you how sorry I was
      for all of my teenage angst and <br />all the nights I was out and manic
      and you were home and waiting <br />and worrying. <br />I am still a
      coward now. <br />Maybe the guru was right. <br />Maybe forgiving myself
      really is the greatest act of kindness. <br />But I don’t make a habit
      <br />of forgiving those I hate.
